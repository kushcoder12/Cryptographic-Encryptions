# Welcome to the Cryptographic Encryption Repository

Unlock the mysteries of cryptography and safeguard your digital world!

This repository is your gateway to understanding the art and science of cryptographic encryption. Explore a collection of resources designed to unveil the secrets of secure communication and data protection.

I request the community of open source to contribute to this REPO so that budding Security enthusiasts can learn and interact in real-time with hands-on learning. 


## Encryptions

Encryptions in this repo:

**Subtitution.py** 

Swap letters, hide your secrets! 

Substitution ciphers shuffle plain text, replacing characters with others based on a key.

Simple yet powerful, used for centuries and perfect for fun GitHub projects.

Encrypt messages, baffle friends, and add a playful crypto twist to your code!


**RSA.py**

Generate a public and private key pair - like a lock and key for your data. Share the public key freely, but keep the private key top secret!

Authorized users with the private key can easily decrypt the information on their own devices, granting access to the sensitive data.
## Output
